      # Automatically generating CHANGELOGs.
      # Automatically determining a semantic version bump (based on the types of commits landed).
      # Communicating the nature of changes to teammates, the public, and other stakeholders.
      # Triggering build and publish processes.
      # Making it easier for people to contribute to your projects, by allowing them to explore a more structured commit history.
      # Need to add support for trailers
